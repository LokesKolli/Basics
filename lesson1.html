		<h2>What is Security?</h2>
		<p>Welcome to CyberSafe Kids! In this lesson, we're going to talk about what security means and why it's important. Security is like having a special shield that protects us from bad people who might try to hurt us or steal our information. Just like how we lock our doors at home to keep our family and belongings safe, we need to take steps to keep our online information safe too.</p>

		<h2>Why is Security Important?</h2>
		<p>Security is important because it helps keep us safe from people who might try to hurt us or steal our information. Imagine if someone got into your email account and sent mean messages to your friends! Or what if someone stole your password and got into your favorite game? That would be very bad! But if we take steps to keep our information safe, we can prevent those bad things from happening.</p>
